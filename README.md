# SmashedToAtoms Emacs Config

This is my minimum effective emacs config.  I really only use this for Common Lisp ([Sly](https://github.com/joaotavora/sly)), Clojure ([Cider](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider)), and Git ([Magit](https://magit.vc)), so it doesn't have config for much else beyond those and Markdown and Org Mode for docs.  I use Visual Studio Code for most everything else.

I am putting this up in case someone else finds it useful.  It is based heavily on [Eno Compton's Config](https://giters.com/enocom/emacs.d).  He did all the hard work.
